<h1>Security</h1>

GigaSpaces security is used to secure numerous demanding environments at different levels of security.
GigaSpaces provides a default security implementation with some handy extension points.

<h2>Custom Extensions</h2>

<h3>Encoding</h3>
The default GigaSpaces security implementation uses MD5 as the default algorithm to encrypt passwords (see <code>PasswordEncoder</code>), 
and AES as the default algorithm to encrypt contents stored in a file (see <code>ContentEncoder</code>).

<h3>File-Service</h3>
The default GigaSpaces security implementation stores the users and roles in a local file-system. 
The <code>FileService</code> interface defines the file access mechanism; The default implementation is the 
<code>LocalFileService</code>. It can be replaced by <code>URLFileService</code> to read the file contents from an HTTP Server.

<h2>Custom Security</h2>
The main security interface is <code>SecurityManager</code> which is responsible for authentication and creating of the 
<code>DirectoryManager</code>. These are the two interfaces of interest when implementing your own custom security.
